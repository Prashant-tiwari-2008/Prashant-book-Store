Route Parameters vs. Query Parameters:

Route parameters: These are dynamic values that are part of the URL path. They are used to specify specific resources or data within a route. In your case, /books/:id defines :id as a route parameter.
Query parameters: These are optional key-value pairs appended to the URL after a question mark (?). They are used to provide additional information or filters for the request.
In your case:

The URL http://localhost:4001/api/v1/book/?id=B001 contains a query parameter: id=B001.
Express.js will match this URL to the route routes.get("/", getAllBooks); because it doesn't have a route parameter defined for id.
To fix this:

You need to create a route that specifically handles query parameters for id:

JavaScript
routes.get("/?id=:id", getSingleBook);
Use code with caution.

This route will match URLs that have a query parameter named id. Now, when you hit http://localhost:4001/api/v1/book/?id=B001, it will correctly call the getSingleBook controller.

Alternative:

If you prefer to use route parameters for id, you can modify your URL to:

http://localhost:4001/api/v1/book/B001
This will directly match the routes.get("/:id", getSingleBook); route and call the getSingleBook controller.
