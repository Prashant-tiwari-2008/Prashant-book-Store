        "longdesc": "<p><strong>The phenomenal international bestseller: over 10 million copies sold worldwide</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A New York Times and Sunday Times bestseller</strong></p>\n<p><em>Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.</em></p>\n<p>People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.</p>\n<p>In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.</p>\n<p>These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.</p>\n<p><strong>Praises for <em>Atomic Habits</em>:</strong></p>\n<p>'A supremely practical and useful book.' <em>&mdash;Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck</em></p>\n<p>'James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones.' <em>&mdash;Adam Grant, author of Originals</em></p>\n<p>'Atomic Habits is a step-by-step manual for changing routines.' <em>&mdash;Books of the Month, Financial Times</em></p>\n<p>'A special book that will change how you approach your day and live your life.' <em>&mdash;Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle is the Way</em></p>",

This is why we resist efforts to change, often until they feel completely futile. But by extracting crucial insight from our most damaging habits, building emotional intelligence by better understanding our brains and bodies, releasing past experiences at a cellular level, and learning to act as our highest potential future selves, we can step out of our own way and into our potential.</p>\n<p>For centuries, the mountain has been used as a metaphor for the big challenges we face, especially ones that seem impossible to overcome. To scale our mountains, we actually have to do the deep internal work of excavating trauma, building resilience, and adjusting how we show up for the climb. In the end, it is not the mountain we master, but ourselves.</p>",

It's the Japanese word for 'a reason to live' or 'a reason to jump out of bed in the morning'. It's the place where your needs, desires, ambitions, and satisfaction meet. A place of balance. Small wonder that finding your ikigai is closely linked to living longer. Finding your ikigai is easier than you might think. This book will help you work out what your own ikigai really is, and equip you to change your life. You have a purpose in this world: your skills, your interests, your desires and your history have made you the perfect candidate for something. All you have to do is find it. Do that, and you can make every single day of your life joyful and meaningful.</p>\n<p><br /><em>Ikigai</em> gently unlocks simple secrets we can all use to live long, meaningful, happy lives. Science-based studies weave beautifully into honest, straight-talking conversation you won't be able to put down. Warm, patient, and kind, this book pulls you gently along your own journey rather than pushing you from behind.'

        "longdesc": "<p><strong>This international bestseller, featuring a bonus chapter previously available only to Darius' online subscribers, is available in India for the first time.</strong></p>\n<p>I know something about you without knowing you. I bet you spend A LOT of time in your head. You know, thinking, worrying, stressing, freaking out -- call it whatever you want. I call it a preoccupied mind. And with what? 99% of your thoughts are useless. William James, once the leading psychologist in America, and one of the founders of the philosophical school of pragmatism, put it best: \"A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices.\" Pragmatism believes that the mind is a tool. Your mind should work for you, not against you. People who don't master their mind, don't believe it's possible. They say: \"I can't help but thinking these things.\" Well, you can TAKE CONTROL of your mind with enough practice. I've done it. And in THINK STRAIGHT, I share exactly how. It's a quick read and you can use it to immediately to improve your thinking. You have the ability to decide what you think. Or, you can choose NOT to think. And that is one of the most important and most practical things you can learn in life. Before I learned that skill, I would spend hours and hours inside my head. Just think about how much you think. - \"I wonder what my boss thinks?\" - \"What happens if I screw up and lose my job?\" - \"What if my business never takes off?\" - \"Does she love me?\" - \"Why does my life suck?\" - \"What if I get cancer?\" - \"I can't finish anything. What's wrong with me? And the list goes on. THINK STRAIGHT reveals the recipe for taking control of your mind so you can improve your life, career, relationships, business. I wrote this little book in a way that you can read it more than once. And I hope that this book serves as an anchor to you--especially during trying times. The mind is the most powerful tool on earth. Change the way you think. And you'll change your life.</p>",

Fascinated by many rags to riches stories you must have been in the same situation which I used to be in my earlier days reading stories of how people like Rakesh Jhunjhunwala earned their money and built their empires. But there is no road map!Being an online entrepreneur I was always intrigued by stock market trading because the stock market is an apt way of making money using money. But all good books resources were directed towards the US markets. Also There was no good like-minded community. So I joined the Forex factory and started with currency trading - Forex.Volatility doesn’t only create irrational pricing in stock prices only. It also creates irrational pricing in every other instrument which includes options as well. Our aim is to capture this mispricing.The aim of this book is to understand the effect of option pricing in cases of volatility contraction and volatility expansion. The book is not for beginners.

It is an examination of the global financial system as a whole with the practical goal of being able to create a functional profitable investment strategy or business model. Splitting Markets is your alternative to a college degree in finance (and a lot cheaper!). By understanding the financial system as a whole one can understand better your specialty whether you are in mortgage lending or Credit Default Swaps. Splitting Markets dissects the global financial system bit by bit; byte by byte. Markets have changed in the past 50 years but educational material has not. That leaves Wall St. traders to engage in on-site training at their firm often not providing a comprehensive view of the realities of the entire market. We hope that Splitting Markets is a comprehensive work that fills that gap and that it becomes one day required reading in courses of international finance macroeconomics and foreign trade.",
